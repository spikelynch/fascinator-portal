<p>jQuery UI offers great features for building tabbed layouts with relative
    ease, and Jaffa merely extends on this. Here's a sample content block that
    Jaffa can use:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;div class="my-tab-class"&gt;
    &lt;h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-1"&gt;Heading 1&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div id="tab-1"&gt;Content Block 1&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-2"&gt;Heading 2&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div id="tab-2"&gt;Content Block 2&lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-3"&gt;Heading 3&lt;/h3&gt;
    &lt;div id="tab-3"&gt;Content Block 3&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Jaffa lets you turn this into a tabbed layout without much effort by building
    the additional navigation HTML required by the jQuery UI. Like so:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
jaffa.ui.changeToTabLayout($(".my-tab-class"), "h3");
</pre>

<p>Here we handed Jaffa our tabbed content area
    (<code class="prettyprint lang-js">$(".my-tab-class")</code>) as a jQuery
    element and told it how to find the headings using a CSS selector
    (<code class="prettyprint">"h3"</code>). From here Jaffa can follow the
    information embedded in the HTML to build our navigation. This results in
    the tabbed layout shown here:</p>
<!-- This gets activated in myJaffa.js after jaffa loads. -->
<div class="my-tab-class">
    <h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-1">Heading 1</h3>
    <div id="tab-1">Content Block 1</div>
    <h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-2">Heading 2</h3>
    <div id="tab-2">Content Block 2</div>
    <h3 jaffa-tab-id="tab-3">Heading 3</h3>
    <div id="tab-3">Content Block 3</div>
</div>

<p>Why is this useful though? It is fairly close to to what jQuery UI does
    anyway, except rather then build a central navigation structure, we've
    instead spread the additional HTML out throughout the content.</p>
<p>If your server-side application builds a complicated front-end through
    template execution however, it is not uncommon to find that the entire form
    can be spread across many templates without any knowledge of each other. You
    may even include or exclude templates from executing based on server-side
    conditions (like security) requiring you to alter the navigation HTML as
    well as the content. This alternative setup offers the option of letting
    Jaffa do that work for, so long as each section of the form provides the
    appropriate IDs/headings:</p>
<ul>
    <li>A heading that can be found using the common CSS selector.</li> 
    <li>The heading should contain an attribute <code class="prettyprint">jaffa-tab-id</code>
        which points at the ID of a content block.</li> 
    <li>The content block with ID matching above.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Of course, you have jQuery UI available to you in this setup as well, so you
    can use either approach interchangeably as conditions dictate.</p>
