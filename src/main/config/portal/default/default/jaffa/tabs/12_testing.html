<p>This page also executes a number of unit tests against Jaffa, and includes
    support for <a href="http://fireunit.org/">FireUnit</a> if you happen to
    have it installed. FireUnit will provide you with more options for tracking
    test failures back to their original location if you are doing development,
    but you should hopefully be able to achieve something in all browsers.</p>
<p>TODO: Eithre brute force a delay or be more intelligent in loading. The first
 time visitors gets unit test failures... presumably as page resources have not
  loaded yet?</p>

    the profiling information below as well:</p>
