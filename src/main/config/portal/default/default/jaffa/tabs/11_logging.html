<p>By default Jaffa will internally log at various levels to the browser Console (if it is available):</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DEBUG</strong>: Disabled unless <code class="prettyprint">debuggingEnabled: true</code> is set in configuration. Used during development, but not recommended unless you are hunting bugs.</li>
    <li><strong>INFO</strong>: Information on significant events occurring during normal operation.</li>
    <li><strong>WARN</strong>: Problems/errors (or just potential ones) that do not halt operation of Jaffa will be reported here.</li>
    <li><strong>ERROR</strong>: Fatal errors that Jaffa (or just the utility you are using) will halt operations for are reported here, and also displayed in a dialog to the user.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Custom Logging</h4>
<p>Providing custom logging is somewhat similar to what we've already seen on the 'Alerts' tab, we
    just provide a custom function in the <code class="prettyprint">functionLog</code> configuration.
    Here is an example we use for this page to add a scolling log to this tab (below), although I've
    snipped out some of the less relevant stuff to avoid bloat. Perhaps it would be useful (along
    with debugging) on your site if the user is a super user?</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var logging = null;
var debugLogging = function(type, message) {
    if (logging == null) {
        logging = $(".jaffa-logs");
    }
    var logLine = "&lt;div class='log-row'&gt;";
    logLine += "&lt;span class='time'&gt;" + now() + "&lt;/span&gt;";
    logLine += "&lt;span class='level'&gt;" + type + "&lt;/span&gt;";
    logLine += "&lt;span class='message'&gt;" + message + "&lt;/span&gt;";
    logLine += "&lt;/div&gt;";
    logging.prepend(logLine);
    // Send them to Jaffa's standard log as well, the null test
    //  avoids some issues in IE due to startup timing.
    if (jaffa != null) {
        jaffa.log(type, message);
    }
};

jaffa = jaffaFactory({
        debuggingEnabled: true,
        functionLog: debugLogging
    });
</pre>

<p>So with appropriate styling you can see the output in the fake 'window' below:</p>
<div class="well">
    <h4>Jaffa framework logging (example for Administrators):</h4>
    <div class="jaffa-logs log-scroller">
        <div class="log-row">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
