<h3>Getting Jaffa</h3>
<p>We start by loading our Jaffa Library... in any form. This page is using a
    full non-minified version for development, but you can load any version you
    like. Some options:</p>
<ul>
    <li>TODO: Minified Build</li>
    <li>TODO: Release Build</li>
    <li>TODO: Development Build</li>
</ul>
<p>You can see here I've also loaded up my own script where I put all the
    instantiation and configuration for how I use Jaffa. You may prefer to do
    this in some other way... it doesn't really matter. Examples of
    configuration and customization on this demo page and the instantiation code
    below are generally located inside that script.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-html">
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="jaffa.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type="text/javascript" src="myJaffa.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Starting Jaffa</h3>
<p>At its simplest, starting Jaffa involves requesting an instance from the
    <code class="prettyprint">jaffaFactory()</code> method and providing it with
    a configuration object... empty in this case.</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var jaffa = jaffaFactory({});
</pre>
<p>Of course, in most circumstances you are going to want to provide some
    configuration to Jaffa, so let's look at a basic example of that as well. In
    this example we are going to enable debug logging, as well as specifying a
    callback function of our own that we would like Jaffa to execute after it
    has performed all instantiation activity:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function jaffaLoaded(jaffa) {
    alert("Woot! Jaffa is loaded!");
}

var jaffa = jaffaFactory({
        debuggingEnabled: true,
        callbackStartupComplete: jaffaLoadedFunction
    });
</pre>
