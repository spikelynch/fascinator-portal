<h3>What is Jaffa?</h3>
<p>Jaffa is a JavaScript Form Framwork, built on jQuery, designed to mimic form
    behaviour using AJAX and JSON. Many additional features aim to make these
    forms feature rich, user friendly and easy to deploy.</p>

<h3>When is Jaffa useful?</h3>
<p>Jaffa was primarily developed to deliver browser based data entry forms for
    servers that store their metadata in JSON. This design fundamental allows
    the data to remain lightweight and accessible throughout its lifecycle; it
    lives on the server as JSON, transports between the client and server as
    JSON and Jaffa backs the form-like interface into a JSON data model whilst
    executing in the browser.</p>

<h3>What can Jaffa do?</h3>
<p>The interfaces and features provided by Jaffa aim to give all the usual
    functionality of a well designed HTML form, and make more tedious tasks
    simple for developers, such as validation, user help and data lookups.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that Jaffa makes no efforts to style form controls beyond
    what is provided by your application's existing style framework(s) (if any).
    It does depend on jQuery UI however, so there are many easy to implement
    options this will provide for you. This demonstration page shows off the
    various features that Jaffa provides when combined with a standard tool such
    as Bootstrap along with jQuery UI.</p>
