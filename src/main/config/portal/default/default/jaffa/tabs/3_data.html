<h3>Loading Data</h3>
<p>The most important part of this whole scenario is your data. First, Jaffa is
    going to need to know how to get it from the server, although that's pretty
    easy, we just tell it where to go with our configuration:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
var jaffa = jaffaFactory({
        urlDataSource: "/server/path/formData.json"
    });
</pre>

<p>This could be either a relative or absolute URL; it makes no difference (XSS
    considerations aside). Eventually it will make its way down into a
    <code class="prettyprint">jQuery.ajax()</code> call, exactly as you have
    provided it, so it simply needs to be resolvable from the current
    page/domain.</p>

<h3>Managed Data</h3>
<p>On the next tab you'll find information about how Jaffa finds and manages
    your form's GUI elements. Every field that Jaffa is aware of in this way is
    considered 'managed', and (in a perfect world) every managed field will be
    paired up with some of your server provided data. When one changes, so
    should the other, and ultimately, when the form is 'submitted' we are going
    to send the resulting JSON data back to the server for storage.</p>

<p>Because this demonstration page does not need to submit any data to the server,
    we can override the JSON submission method and route the output into the page
    itself. The below field has been modified so that after any edits it manually
    forces a form submission and you should see the form data in the area below
    that update (<b>Note:</b> Tab swapping through the demo also causes an
    'auto-save' that triggers this submission as well). This is the JSON that
    would be normally sent to the server from the form elements spread across
    all tabs of this demonstration.</p>

<p>
    <label for="aaaFirstFieldDemo">
        Edit this field:
        <input type="text" id="aaaFirstFieldDemo" class="jaffa-field" value="Field 'aaaFirstFieldDemo'" />
        and the JSON below will change.
    </label>
</p>

<div id="showMeTheJson" class="alert alert-info">You need to edit the field above to see JSON here.</div>
<p><i>Apologies to IE users, but after <a href="http://code.google.com/p/google-code-prettify/issues/detail?id=158">patching prettify.js</a>
    to support webkit browsers I gave up on getting <code class="prettyprint">prettyPrintOne()</code>
    to preserve newlines under IE.</i></p>

<h3>Unmanaged Data</h3>
<p>But what about a non-perfect world? Perhaps the server sends Jaffa some data
    that your form has no controls for and no knowledge of... what should we do?
    Well the answer is (as always) configurable, but by default Jaffa considers
    'unmanaged' data to be important enough to halt functioning. Form submission
    is disabled so data is never sent back to the server.</p>
<p>In this context unmanaged data is considered to be an error where
    your form and data do not match, and the potential for corrupting your data
    is held to be the most important thing to avoid.</p>
<p><i>It is worth noting that the reverse scenario (no server data for a managed
    field exists) is not significant. This is what a brand new record would
    probably look like since no data is stored for it yet.</i></p>

<h3>Give it to me anyway</h3>
<p>So you know what you are doing, you want the form to keep working and you'll
    handle the unmanaged data yourself; either on the server, or in the client
    (our demo below)? Ok, here's how you can do it.</p>

<p>What we would like to do as a trivial demonstration is give Jaffa a callback
    function to execute whenever it comes across some unmanaged data. The
    configuration has a really imaginative property name:
    <code class="prettyprint">callbackUnmanagedServerData</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
function unmanagedData(fieldName) {
    $("#unmanagedDataAlerts").append("... Unmanaged field '" + fieldName + "' in server data! ...");
}

var jaffa = jaffaFactory({
        callbackUnmanagedServerData: unmanagedData
    });
</pre>

<p>There's some HTML wrapping snipped out of there, but really all we are doing
    is pushing our notifications into the alert box setup below:</p>

<div id="unmanagedDataAlerts" class="alert alert-error">
    <h4>Unmanaged Data</h4><br/>
</div>

<p>Now's a good time to show how we achieved some of the demo content above,
    namely how we forced the submission process to proceed, even though there
    was unmanaged data, and also how we redirected the submission process to
    display our JSON:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
// Look for a change event on that control and start a submit().
// You can target specific fields in other ways, this is a more global callback
function onDataChanged(fieldName) {
    if (fieldName == "aaaFirstFieldDemo") {
        jaffa.form.submit();
    }
}

// Returning 'true' from this (optional) callback forces a submission. We are
//  provided the 'invalidData' flag and all the data to let us make a decision
function preSubmission(invalidData, serverData) {
    return true;
}

// This overrides Jaffa's internal submission process
function submissionOverride(invalidData, serverData) {
    var jsonString = JSON.stringify(serverData, null, 4);
    // &lt;snip&gt; ... some prettifying of the JSON + add some headings
    $("#showMeTheJson").append(jsonString);
}

// How our config gets into Jaffa
jaffa = jaffaFactory({
        // Callbacks
        callbackOnDataChanged: onDataChanged,
        callbackPreSubmission: preSubmission,
        // Overide an internal function
        functionSubmitData: submissionOverride
    });
</pre>

<h3>Advanced Usage</h3>
<p>This section will make more sense if you've looked at the some of other tabs,
    so you may want to come back to it later.</p>

<p>We can go a step further and 'solve' the problem of unmanaged data by adding
    additional form fields after the data loads; first the code, then below you
    can see it in action:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint lang-js">
// Config during Jaffa's startup
function newmanagedData(fieldName) {
    $("#unmanagedDataAlerts #unmanaged-" + fieldName).remove();
    $("#managedDataAlerts").append("&lt;p&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon-info-sign\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Field '" + fieldName + "' is now managed.&lt;/p&gt;");
}

function unmanagedData(fieldName) {
    $("#unmanagedDataAlerts").append("&lt;p id=\"unmanaged-" + fieldName + "\"&gt;&lt;i class=\"icon-warning-sign\"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Unmanaged field '" + fieldName + "' in server data!&lt;/p&gt;");
}

var jaffa = jaffaFactory($, {
        callbackUnmanagedServerData: unmanagedData,
        callbackNewManagedServerData: newmanagedData
    });

// Click events
$("#data-manage-text").click(function() {
    var newInput = $("&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"formText\" /&gt;");
    $("#data-manage-text-span").html(newInput);
    jaffa.form.addField("formText");
});
$("#data-manage-date").click(function() {
    var newInput = $("&lt;input type=\"text\" id=\"formDate\" /&gt;");
    $("#data-manage-date-span").html(newInput);
    jaffa.form.addField("formDate");
    newInput.datepicker({dateFormat: 'yy-mm-dd' });
});
</pre>

<p>And this setup results in the behaviour you'll see below:</p>
<div id="unmanagedDataControls" class="alert alert-info">
    <h4>Unmanaged Data Controls</h4>
    <p>This content block will have no form inputs when the page loads, but as you press one of the buttons below the following will occur:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>We will build some form inputs using jQuery.</li>
        <li>Notify Jaffa that we have a new form input with a matching ID.</li>
        <li>Jaffa will consider the data to now be 'managed' and fire our callback.</li>
        <li>The callback will remove our entry from the error alert above and drop a success alert below.</li>
        <li>Our earlier example of data submitted to the server will contain the newly managed field.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="data-manage-text"><i class="icon-align-left icon-white"></i> Manage 'formText'</button>
        <span id="data-manage-text-span"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="data-manage-textarea"><i class="icon-align-left icon-white"></i> Manage 'formTextarea'</button>
        <span id="data-manage-textarea-span"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="data-manage-date"><i class="icon-calendar icon-white"></i> Manage 'formDate'</button>
        <span id="data-manage-date-span"></span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <button class="btn btn-primary" id="data-manage-utf8"><i class="icon-align-left icon-white"></i> Manage Japanese UTF-8</button>
        <span id="data-manage-textarea-utf8"></span>
    </p>
</div>

<div id="managedDataAlerts" class="alert alert-success">
    <h4>Newly Managed Data</h4><br/>
</div>
